# Overview of Custom Search Results app template

## Build a message extension from OpenAPI description document

This app template allows Teams to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities and broadening its range of capabilities. It allows Teams to:

- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my team’s design files in Figma.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts).
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Create app by clicking `Provision` in "Lifecycle" section.

{{#OAuth}}
> [!NOTE]
> If your identity server needs Proof of Key Code Exchange (PKCE) for token exchange, uncomment the `isPKCEEnabled` property in the` oauth/register` section of the `m365agents.yml` file shown as below:
```yaml
  - uses: oauth/register
    with:
      name: {{ApiSpecAuthName}}
      flow: authorizationCode
      # app ID
      appId: ${{TEAMS_APP_ID}}
      # Path to OpenAPI description document
      apiSpecPath: {{{ApiSpecPath}}}
      # Uncomment below property to use proof key for code exchange (PKCE)
      isPKCEEnabled: true
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
      configurationId: {{ApiSpecAuthRegistrationIdEnvName}}
```
> Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will ask you for your Client ID and Client Secret for Oauth2 during provision. These information will be securely stored with [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home) and used by Teams client to access your API in runtime. Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will not store your Client ID and Client Secret.
