# Overview of the Chat With Your Data (Using Microsoft 365 Data) template

This app template showcases how to build one of the most powerful applications enabled by LLM - sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chat bots that can answer questions about specific source information right in the Microsoft Teams.
This app template also demonstrates usage of techniques like: 
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#what-is-rag), or RAG.
- [Microsoft Graph Search API](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/search-concept-overview)
- [Microsoft Teams SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams%20conversational%20ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview)

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
> To run the agent template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

### Debug agent in Teams Web Client
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. Ensure your OpenAI API Key is filled in `env/.env.local.user`.
    ```
    SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
    ```
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Ensure your Azure OpenAI settings are filled in `env/.env.local.user`.
    ```
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-azure-openai-api-key>"
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your-azure-openai-deployment-name>"
    ```
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Microsoft Graph Search API is available for searching SharePoint content, thus you just need to ensure your document in *data/\*.md* is [uploaded to SharePoint / OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/upload-files-and-folders-to-a-library-da549fb1-1fcb-4167-87d0-4693e93cb7a0), no extra data ingestion required.
2. In the debug dropdown menu, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
