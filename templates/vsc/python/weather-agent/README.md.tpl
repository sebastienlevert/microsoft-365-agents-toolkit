# Overview of the Weather Agent template

This app template is built on top of [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://aka.ms/m365-agents-sdk) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).
This template showcases a weather agent app that responds to user questions about weather forecasts. This enables your users to ask for weather information in Teams and get accurate, formatted responses.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Python](https://www.python.org/), version 3.8 to 3.11.
> - [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), version v2024.0.1 or higher.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli).
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - An account with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access).
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts).

### Configurations
1. Open the command box and enter `Python: Create Environment` to create and activate your desired virtual environment. Remember to select `src/requirements.txt` as dependencies to install when creating the virtual environment.
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` and endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY`. 
1. In this template, default model name is `gpt-4o`. If you want to use a different model from OpenAI, fill in your model name in [src/config.py](./src/config.py).
{{/useOpenAI}}

### Conversation with agent
1. Select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
1. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
1. You will receive a welcome message from the agent, or send any message about weather to get a response.

**Congratulations**! You are running a weather agent that can now interact with users in Teams:

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).
