# Overview of the AI Agent template

This template showcases an agent that responds to user questions like an AI assistant. This enables your users to talk with the AI assistant in Teams to find information.

The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based applications.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
> To run the agent template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

## Create your Assistant 
**Before running or debugging your agent, follow these steps to setup your own Assistant.**

> This app template provides script `Create-Assistant.ps1` to help create assistant. The app assistant provides capabilities such as solving a math problem, calling functions for city weather and city nickname. Get more information in `ActionHandlers.cs`. You can change the instructions and settings in the script to customize assistant.
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. Ensure your OpenAI settings filled in `appsettings.Playground.json`.
    ```
    "OpenAI": {
      "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>"
    }
    ```
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Ensure your Azure OpenAI settings filled in `appsettings.Playground.json`.
    ```
    "Azure": {
      "OpenAIApiKey": "<your-azure-openai-api-key>",
      "OpenAIEndpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>",
      "OpenAIDeploymentName": "<your-azure-openai-deployment-name>"
    }
    ```
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Open PowerShell, change the current working directory to this project root and run command `. ./Create-Assistant.ps1`.
   ```
   > . ./Create-Assistant.ps1
   ```
1. The above command will display the properties of the newly created assistant, including the ID like "id: asst_xxx...". 
1. Fill in your assistant id in `env/.env.local.user`, `env/.env.dev.user` and `appsettings.Playground.json`.
