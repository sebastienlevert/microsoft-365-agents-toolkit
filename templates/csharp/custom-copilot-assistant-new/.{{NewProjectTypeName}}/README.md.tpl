# Overview of the AI Agent template

This template showcases an agent that responds to user questions like an AI assistant. This enables your users to talk with the AI assistant in Teams to find information.

The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based applications.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
> To run the agent template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource
