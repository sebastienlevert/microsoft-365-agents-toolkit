# Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI (Command Line Tool)

Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI is a text-based command line interface that can help scaffold, validate, and deploy applications for Microsoft 365 from the terminal or a CI/CD process.

![CLI](https://aka.ms/cli-hero-image)

## Getting Started

Let's start by installing `@microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli` from NPM and run `atk -h` to check all available commands:

```powershell
$ npm install -g @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli
$ atk -h
```

> [!NOTE]
> Please refer to [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI Documentation](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli) for in-depth instructions.

## Import and edit local agent packages

Graduate a local exported declarative-agent ZIP or extracted folder into a new native
Toolkit project, then apply a separately reviewed JSON edit document:

```powershell
atk import agent --source ".\exported-agent.zip" --output ".\new-agent" --dry-run --format json -i false
atk import agent --source ".\exported-agent.zip" --output ".\new-agent" --format json -i false
atk edit agent --folder ".\new-agent" --changes ".\changes.json" --dry-run --format json -i false
atk edit agent --folder ".\new-agent" --changes ".\changes.json" --format json -i false
```

`--output` is the **exact new directory**, not a parent directory. Existing targets
are rejected. If omitted, the default is `<source-basename>-imported` in the current
directory; an `appPackage` folder uses its parent basename. `--source`, and the
edit command's `--folder` and `--changes`, are required.

Both local operations are always noninteractive, including when invoked in-process or with
`-i true`. Missing flags return named errors, never prompts. The `--source` import and edit use only local files
and bundled assets: no network, authentication, AI, source-script execution,
provisioning, or publishing. Startup online checks and telemetry are disabled for
these two commands. Generated lifecycle files are not executed.

For example, `changes.json` can explicitly replace instructions:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "agentId": "localAgent",
  "operations": [
    {
      "kind": "replaceInstructions",
      "sourceFile": "approved-instructions.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the logical agent ID from `copilotAgents.declarativeAgents[].id`, not a deployment
ID. Edit-document asset paths are relative to the JSON file's directory. To prevent
applying changes to a stale project, pass `--expected-digest` with a previously returned
`projectDigest` (`sha256:<hex>`). This precondition also applies to dry runs and no-ops.

With `--format json`, stdout contains exactly one envelope:
`{"success":true,"result":<complete report>}` or
`{"success":false,"error":{"source":"...","name":"...","message":"..."}}`.
Progress and human-readable errors use stderr. Without `--format`, the complete
report is pretty-printed. Diagnostics and configuration requirements are retained;
local structural validity does **not** establish provisioning or publishing readiness.

| Outcome | Exit code |
| --- | --- |
| Import, edit, no-op, or dry run | `0` |
| Validation, path, stale-digest, or other error | `1` |
| Ctrl+C cancellation | `130` |
| `--help` or `--version` | `0` (ordinary help/version text, not a report) |

Import never changes its source package. Edit preserves existing identity and environment
configuration. Dry runs commit no changes, and no-ops do not rewrite project files.
Use `atk import agent --help` or `atk edit agent --help` for command options.
These commands are separate from the existing `import agentplugin` / `import openplugin`
conversion commands.

### Import a returned launch-info snapshot

```powershell
atk import agent --title-id SyntheticTitle-001 --output ".\new-agent" --dry-run --format json -i false
atk import agent --title-id SyntheticTitle-001 --output ".\new-agent" --format json -i false
```

Supply exactly one of `--source` and `--title-id`. Title-ID acquisition requires
an already signed-in selected native account and remains strictly noninteractive:
no browser/device login, account switch, password-provider fallback, or consent.
It performs bounded read-only MOS requests and anonymous approved-CDN icon reads.
Authentication-required errors exit 2; other failures exit 1 and cancellation
exits 130. No install, acquire, provisioning, publishing, or source update occurs.

The JSON envelope is unchanged, but a Title-ID result has `reportVersion: 2` and
`source.kind: "title-id"`. Local import and edits still return version 1.
The returned DA snapshot is the source, not an original ZIP or a maker draft.
Source instructions/capabilities/color are preserved. The new container's
unavailable original legal/developer metadata and outline branding are generated
native scaffold defaults, explicitly reported as needing review. The small
preview icon is not substituted for an outline icon. Unsupported element groups
or missing required local dependency/asset bytes fail with ZIP remediation.

See the [Title-ID contract](../../docs/03-specs/operations/scaffolding/import-agent-from-title.md)
for the profile, suffix normalization, complete snapshot fingerprint, and
historical `.atk/import.json` provenance.

See the [import contract](../../docs/03-specs/operations/scaffolding/import-agent-package.md),
[supported edit operations](../../docs/03-specs/operations/scaffolding/apply-agent-edits.md),
and [local import/edit scenario](../../docs/03-specs/scenarios/agent-package/import-and-edit.md)
for the authoritative supported dialect, limits, transactional behavior, and report contract.

## Data Collection

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default. To opt out, please add the global option `--telemetry false` for each command to turn it off.
The local `import agent` and `edit agent` commands never initialize or send telemetry.
