# Contributing to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI 

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI!

Please review this document for setting up your development environment, debugging, and run Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI. If you have any questions, please raise your issue on github.

## Prerequisites
---

Verify you have the right prerequisites for building apps:

### M365 account

The Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI requires a Microsoft 365 organizational account where the app is running and has been registered.

### Azure account
The Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI may require an Azure account and subscription to deploy the Azure resources for your project.

**_NOTE:_** Don't have a Microsoft 365 tenant to experience building the app? Sign up for [M365 Developer Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant), which allows you to have a testing tenant with preconfigured permissions.

## Setup Development Environment
---

1. Install Node v18 or later
2. Install PNPM v8 or later

## Build the project
---

### Build the whole monorepo
1. `git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx.git`
2. `cd TeamsFx`
3. `npm run setup`

This will run "pnpm install && npm run build" to link packages in monorepo locally. 


## Debug the project
---

### Run your local project
1. `cd TeamsFx`
2. `npm run setup`
3. `npm link`

### Debug inside VSCode
1. `cd TeamsFx/packages/cli`
2. `code .`
3. In the debug Treeview choose debugging profile
4. Hit 'F5' or click start debugging button

### Install the published package
1. Run: `npm install -g @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli` (Pls check the version is the latest version)
2. Now the package is installed in your global npm folder. You can type 'atk -h' to see how to use the cli tool.

## Test the proejct
---

### Run Unit test

1. `cd TeamsFx/packages/cli`
2. `npm run test:unit`

### Run E2E test

1. `cd TeamsFx/packages/cli`
2. `npm run test:e2e`

**_NOTE:_** When run E2E tests it may pop up windows to ask you to login your Azure account or M365 account, please login your accout to continue the test.

### Local agent import/edit acceptance tests

After the upstream API/core packages and their bundled assets are built, run from
`packages\cli`:

```powershell
pnpm run build
pnpm exec vitest run tests\unit\commands\agentPackage.tests.ts tests\unit\commands\agentPackage.process.tests.ts --config vitest.config.ts --maxWorkers=2
```

The [local import/edit scenario](../../docs/03-specs/scenarios/agent-package/import-and-edit.md)
owns these AC-linked surface tests. The command harness uses the public core client,
real package files, and the native template. The process suite launches `cli.js` with
closed stdin and requires the compiled `lib` output. Its fault seams reject network,
external-process attempts, and CWD changes; they do not replace the importer, editor,
or generator. Relative sources and default output paths are tested from a separate
Unicode caller directory, including the `appPackage` parent-basename convention.
No tenant credentials are needed. Cooperative SIGINT is emitted after listener
registration so cancellation is deterministic on Windows as well as Unix.
Fixtures are created beneath this package's test directory and cleaned after each test.

The additive Title-ID path uses only synthetic response/PNG fixtures, fake HTTP
at the transport edge, and the real native generator/import/edit/package code:

```powershell
pnpm exec vitest run tests\unit\commands\agentTitle.tests.ts tests\unit\commonlib\titleSilentLogin.tests.ts --config vitest.config.ts --maxWorkers=2
```

The silent-provider tests forbid browser login, logout/cache clearing, connectivity
probes, and password-provider switching. Never add private launch-info payloads,
real agent instructions/IDs, downloaded tenant images, or credentials as fixtures.

## Coding Style
---

The project setup ESLINT and prettier for coding style and formating, please follow the commands below

### Lint project
`npm run lint`

### Fix lint error
`npm run lint:fix`

### Check code format before commit
`npm run check-format`

### Format the code
`npm run format`

### Add dependency for CLI
`pnpm install XXX`

### Delete dependency for CLI
`pnpm remove XXX`

## Opening PR and PR review
