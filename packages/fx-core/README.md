# TeamsFx Core

The TeamsFx Core package implements shared capabilities for Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit IDE Extensions and the CLI through API contracts defined in the [api](/packages/api).

## Local agent package import and edits

The supported `FxCoreClient` / `IFxCoreClient` boundary exposes two local,
noninteractive operations:

```typescript
const imported = await client.importAgentPackage({
  sourcePath: "exports/agent.zip",
  outputPath: "projects/imported-agent",
  dryRun: true,
});

const edited = await client.applyAgentEdits({
  projectPath: "projects/imported-agent",
  changesFile: "approved/changes.json",
  expectedDigest: reviewedProjectDigest,
});
```

Both return `Result<AgentMigrationReport, FxError>` and accept an optional second
argument `{ signal: AbortSignal }`. Requests, the edit-document schema, and report
types are exported from `@microsoft/teamsfx-api`. ZIP and extracted-folder imports
use the bundled native template and create a **new** project; they never overwrite
an existing directory or take over the source deployment identity.

Edits preserve the current project's deployment/environment identity and apply
only the approved version-1 JSON operations. A dry run changes no project files;
a no-op does not rewrite them. Import and edits do not authenticate, provision,
share, publish, run source code, fetch remote source references, or call AI.
Local structural validity is reported separately from cloud readiness, which is
not evaluated.

See the [import contract](../../docs/03-specs/operations/scaffolding/import-agent-package.md),
[edit contract](../../docs/03-specs/operations/scaffolding/apply-agent-edits.md),
and [workflow](../../docs/03-specs/scenarios/agent-package/import-and-edit.md) for
supported dialects, safety limits, exact collection semantics, and transaction
recovery. Imported instructions use the shared manifest resolver's opt-in
`$[file('instructions.txt', 'raw')]` syntax so literal template-like prose remains
literal when packaged.

The migration profile is independently pinned at
`resource/agent-import/6.16.0/`; it does not read or modify normal creation's
template archive or version configuration. Maintainers can verify the frozen
profile with `pnpm run bundle:agent-import-profile` after building the matching
native template release and core. A content change requires a new profile
version; the command refuses to overwrite an existing different profile.

## Clone a returned Title-ID snapshot

`FxCoreClient.importAgentFromTitle({ titleId, outputPath?, dryRun? }, { signal? })`
creates a new project from the returned launch-info DA snapshot. It uses only
the selected host provider's explicit silent `getStatus` path and bounded MOS
reads, plus anonymous downloads from the supported public icon origins. It
never initiates login, changes accounts, requests consent, calls TDP/Graph,
acquires/installs an agent, or modifies the source.

This operation returns the separate flat `AgentTitleImportReport` (version 2)
and exported `agentTitleImportReportSchema`. Available DA behavior and color
bytes are preserved; absent original container metadata and the outline icon
come from the pinned native scaffold and are explicitly marked for review.
It does not claim to recreate an original ZIP or authoring draft. Required
missing definitions/assets fail instead of being replaced with invented data.

The [Title-ID operation contract](../../docs/03-specs/operations/scaffolding/import-agent-from-title.md)
defines the supported profile, exact snapshot fingerprint, bounded transport,
errors, and provenance. Existing local import and edits retain report version 1.
