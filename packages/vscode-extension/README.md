# Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit - an evolution of Teams Toolkit

## What is Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit?

The Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit, [an evolution of Teams Toolkit](https://aka.ms/M365AgentsToolkit), is designed to help developers create and deploy agents or apps for multiple Microsoft 365 platforms including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365. It can significantly ease your development life by providing integrated [Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) identity, cloud storage access, data from [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/teams-concept-overview), and other services in [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/build-your-first-app/build-bot) with a "zero-configuration" approach.

## Extensive Templates Spectrum

No matter you are building custom extensions for Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft Teams or Microsoft 365. It is easy to find the right template to start with in Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit.

### Build for Microsoft 365 Copilot

You can bring your custom knowledge, skills, and process automation into Microsoft 365 Copilot for your specific needs. You can build your own agents for specific tasks, such as retrieving information, summarizing data, and taking actions like sending emails or updating records. There are two types of agents:

[Declarative Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-declarative-agent) are leveraging the models and AI services built in Copilot. You tailor Copilot by declaring instructions, actions and retrieving knowledge from specified APIs to meet your unique business needs.
[Custom Engine Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-custom-engine-agent) are specialized agent experiences built on any large language model (LLM) and tailored for a specific domain or workflows. You can build your custom orchestrators, foundation models, and you can customize your agent business logic.

### Build for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams platform provides [diverse extensible features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/overview-solution) for developers to customize for their own business scenarios. 

[Teams Bot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/overview) allows users to interact with your web service through text, interactive cards, and task modules. There are chat bots, notification bots, and various bots for different scenarios. And you can evolve Teams bots to [conversational agents for Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams-conversational-ai/ai-ux) with the [Microsoft Teams SDK](https://aka.ms/teams-ai-library-v2). Agents in Teams can understand and respond to user chat in natural language to handle QnA interactions or engage in commands/actions interacting with back-end services.
[Teams Tabs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs?tabs=personal) are webpages embedded directly within Teams. They can be integrated as part of a channel inside a team, in group chats, or as personal apps designed for individual users. 

[Teams Message extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions?tabs=desktop) allow users to interact with your web service directly from the Teams client. They support searching for information or triggering actions in external systems. The outcome can be delivered as a richly formatted card within the conversation.

### Build for Office and Outlook.

You can build your custom [Office Add-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins) that extend and interact with content in Excel, Word, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook. You only need to build one solution and it can run in Office across all these apps.
