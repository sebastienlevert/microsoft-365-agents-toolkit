### Introducing Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit

We’re excited to announce that our product — `Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit`(evolved from Teams Toolkit). This update reflects our broader vision and ongoing commitment to support a wide range of development scenarios across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

As we evolve, we’re expanding beyond Microsoft Teams development to empower developers to build agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot and applications across platforms like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 apps. This broader scope enables us to deliver a more versatile and comprehensive set of tools, templates, and resources to help you create powerful, integrated solutions.

![ATK animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96e34da7-06a5-4632-9243-db823e9edb51)

The name — Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit - better represents the full range of capabilities we now support. We believe this change will help you more easily discover and unlock the potential of building across the Microsoft 365 platforms.

### New Features

- **Use OneDrive and SharePoint as Knowledge Sources in Declarative Agents**

[You can now enhance your declarative agents by connecting them to knowledge sources from OneDrive and SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/knowledge-sources). The toolkit allows agents to retrieve grounded, contextually relevant information from files, folders, and sites a user has access to. To get started, open your declarative agent project and select "Add Capability" → "OneDrive and SharePoint."

<img width="882" alt="SP-capability-da" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bed27ab-fe7f-4c7e-acb6-989b01d6137b" />

- **Leverage Copilot Connectors in Declarative Agents**

Expand your agent’s knowledge base by integrating Copilot connectors. These connectors let you ingest data from third-party data sources into Microsoft Graph, which can then be used within Microsoft 365 Copilot or through a declarative agent. You can add a Copilot connector when creating a declarative agent or use the "Copilot Connectors" template to build and extend your solution to declarative agents later.

<img width="1088" alt="copilot-connector-in-DA" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9a4e48-a9ba-45a4-a7a3-1797cf0fc3f7" />

- **Kiota Integration for Declarative Agents**

We’ve added [Kiota](https://aka.ms/kiota/docs) integration to streamline working with OpenAPI specifications in declarative agent projects. Developers often need to handle OpenAPI documents when defining actions, this update enables developers to search Open API description documentations and easily regenerate actions. The toolkit now uses Kiota to read, process, and generate code from OpenAPI files—making it easier and more consistent to define and consume external APIs within your declarative agents.

<img width="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/906dc3a3-ec83-4cb0-a73d-d1a207876a19" />

- **Build a Copilot connector**
  
You can now get started with building a [Copilot connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-graph-connector) to bring your enterprise data to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Agents. This create new agent/app experience will help you get started by scaffolding all the code you need (creates connection via the Graph API, registers schema & maps items) to start ingesting items into the Microsoft Graph with a sample REST API datasource (GitHub issues API). Then, you can customize it to your needs and specific data sources to get more value from your enterprise data in Microsoft 365 Copilot! 

<img width="889" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7600b5a-0c38-4ee5-be35-15dcf7892289" />

- **Build Custom Engine Agent using Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**

We’ve introduced support for building Custom Engine Agents using the [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/agents-sdk-overview?tabs=csharp). This SDK is a flexible framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI-powered agents across multiple channels — such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, Teams, and custom apps — using the AI services of their choice. It simplifies the creation of agentic patterns with built-in support for state, storage, and channel-specific behaviors.

<img width="1089" alt="CEA-Agents-SDK" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df90331d-fd85-46bc-9d9a-4a1649d6e09c" />

- **Microsoft 365 Agents Playground**
We’re excited to introduce the [Microsoft 365 Agents Playground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-app-test-tool), a component evolved from Teams App Test Tool, which provides a web-based chat environment that simulates the behavior, look, and feel of various channels — such as Copilot and Microsoft Teams — allowing developers to test, debug, and iterate on their agent or app design without the need for complex setup.

<img width="711" alt="Agents-playground" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf9307d-84d0-42a3-bda6-d63e801acb14" />

- **[Preview Feature] Use TypeSpec to build Declarative Agent**

To enhance the developer experience for pro-code agent builders, we see strong value in introducing the option that leverages TypeSpec for Microsoft 365 Copilot. This approach provides a type-safe development experience, reduces dependency on JSON files, improves the developer's inner-loop and offer greater flexibility in generating artifacts for your agents and actions.

### Enhancement

- **Smooth installation for Microsoft 365 Agents Playground**: The toolkit will automatically install NodeJS to avoid unnecessary errors in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground installation, for users who don't have NodeJS installed on their machine.

- **Support SharePoint Framework v1.21**: For Teams tab app using SharePoint Framework, we upgrade to support v1.21.

### Bug Fix

- Enhanced compatibility with previous version of YAML files using old names to ensure smoother migration or continued use of existing projects.
  
- Upgraded dependencies like `axios` to address security vulnerabilities.

- Clear error messages for troubleshooting: Enhanced error messages by explicitly showing YAML file names where missing or unresolved environment variables or no valid app catelog. Show clear error messages to make it easier for users to identify and resolve configuration issues.

- Enhanced logging for CDP client and telemetry for agents development activites.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ebc692-6985-424d-9819-3b263a7e7206)


- **Add Agent Debugging Experience**: To provide a better debugging experience for Agent developers, we have integrated the debugging experience in Microsoft 365 Copilot in-chat debugger (available in developer mode only). You can get a clear picture of what capability and action that your agent is set up with. You can easily view how your agent is executing actions and gain deeper insights into execution details, including success or failure hints for both capabilities and actions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db606aa-fbe9-4da5-a6bf-146d1d251abb)


- **Manage Authentication For Declarative Agent**: When adding actions to your Declarative Agent, you might encounter OpenAPI specifications that lack authentication configurations, even though the actual API calls require OAuth. To address this, we introduce commands that assist users to add and manage authentication for their agents. This enhancement would streamline the process and ensure that your API calls are properly authenticated, making it easier to work with your Declarative Agent.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23d7b4b7-962f-4948-a640-2afc0099c657)


- **Enable Adaptive Card Previewer For Declarative Agent**: We understand that designing an adaptive card for the Declarative Agent has been challenging due to compatibility issues with the Adaptive Card Previewer extension. We're excited to announce that we've now added support to preview Adaptive Card, making the process much smoother and more efficient for you. This enhancement ensures that you can seamlessly design adaptive cards without any hassle.

- **GitHub Copilot Extension Walkthrough**: To make it easier for users to get started with the GitHub Copilot Extension "@teamsapp," Teams Toolkit has added a walkthrough UI experience. This guide helps users understand how to install and use this helpful AI assistant to build Teams apps.

<img width="1306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af92cf1-c784-4e5c-ac2e-9a6e07133546" />

#### Enhancements


- **Use Existing Entra ID Instead of Always Create New**: Teams Toolkit creates Entra ID during debugging. While users are easily blocked by no permission to create Entra ID in their tenant. Now we improve this process to allow users to use an existing Entra ID which can be created by tenant admin. You will need to input the ID and password to continue.

- **Input OpenAI Key to Debug**: Custom Engine Agent projects require an OpenAI key for debugging. Teams Toolkit now allows users to create these projects without inputting the OpenAI key. However, missing this value will definitely cause a failure in preview and debugging. Therefore, an input box will pop up before debug to remind users of the required value.

<img width="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c197d84c-fa87-4269-bfb5-2609c6e00370" />

- **Declarative Agent API Key Authentication**: API Key Authentication in the DA project was implemented using Bearer Tokens in the past. Recently, the Teams platform has added support for developers to specify the key name in the API request header or query URL. As a result, we have updated the corresponding templates to reflect this change.
  
- **Microsoft Entra Manifest**: Teams Toolkit has updated Microsoft Entra app manifest to apply MS Graph format for better integration with platform.

- **Troubleshooting with GitHub Copilot Extension**: Teams Toolkit now improve the troubleshooting experience with GitHub Copilot extension by adding a "Resolve with @teamsapp" button, click this button will ask Teams Toolkit to open the output channel in the editor. Then the GitHub Copilot Chat will use the output log as a reference for troubleshooting requests. Consequently, @teamsapp can read the log and perform troubleshooting.

<img width="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60408b17-4cb2-4e80-805f-f554eae05661" />

- **Publish Teams App**: Refine the "Publish Teams App" UI in Teams Toolkit to reduce confusion. Now there are two buttons: one for publishing the Teams app to your organization and the other for publishing your app to the Teams store. The latter will require users to go to the Teams Developer Portal to complete the publishing process.

<img width="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7acfd7c-a29b-4bda-8baa-c3ff5f5c47c9" />

- **Upgrade to Node 22**: All the app templates in Teams Toolkit now are updated to support Node 22.

- **Add streaming experience in App Test Tool** 

- **Security Enhancement**: 1.Consolidate and standardize the Tab templates for quality and security. This involves ensuring consistency in the use of tools and dependencies, such as using npm packages instead of CDNs and updating the Teams JS version. 2. Upgrade python app templates to use MSI authentication when deploying to Azure.

> Note: This changelog only includes the changes for the stable versions of Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (evolved from Teams Toolkit). For the changelog of pre-released versions, please refer to the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Pre-release Changelog](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/packages/vscode-extension/PRERELEASE.md).

## 6.0.0 - May 19, 2025
This major version upgrade is a milestone as Teams Toolkit evolves to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with a set of awesome new features to provide better development experience for agents building and a brand new icon!

### Introducing Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit

We’re excited to announce that our product — `Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit`(evolved from Teams Toolkit). This update reflects our broader vision and ongoing commitment to support a wide range of development scenarios across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

As we evolve, we’re expanding beyond Microsoft Teams development to empower developers to build agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot and applications across platforms like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 apps. This broader scope enables us to deliver a more versatile and comprehensive set of tools, templates, and resources to help you create powerful, integrated solutions.

![ATK animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96e34da7-06a5-4632-9243-db823e9edb51)

The name — Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit - better represents the full range of capabilities we now support. We believe this change will help you more easily discover and unlock the potential of building across the Microsoft 365 platforms.

### New Features

- **Use OneDrive and SharePoint as Knowledge Sources in Declarative Agents**

[You can now enhance your declarative agents by connecting them to knowledge sources from OneDrive and SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/knowledge-sources). The toolkit allows agents to retrieve grounded, contextually relevant information from files, folders, and sites a user has access to. To get started, open your declarative agent project and select "Add Capability" → "OneDrive and SharePoint."

<img width="882" alt="SP-capability-da" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bed27ab-fe7f-4c7e-acb6-989b01d6137b" />

- **Leverage Copilot Connectors in Declarative Agents**

Expand your agent’s knowledge base by integrating Copilot connectors. These connectors let you ingest data from third-party data sources into Microsoft Graph, which can then be used within Microsoft 365 Copilot or through a declarative agent. You can add a Copilot connector when creating a declarative agent or use the "Copilot Connectors" template to build and extend your solution to declarative agents later.

<img width="1088" alt="copilot-connector-in-DA" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9a4e48-a9ba-45a4-a7a3-1797cf0fc3f7" />

- **Kiota Integration for Declarative Agents**

We’ve added [Kiota](https://aka.ms/kiota/docs) integration to streamline working with OpenAPI specifications in declarative agent projects. Developers often need to handle OpenAPI documents when defining actions, this update enables developers to search Open API description documentations and easily regenerate actions. The toolkit now uses Kiota to read, process, and generate code from OpenAPI files—making it easier and more consistent to define and consume external APIs within your declarative agents.

<img width="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/906dc3a3-ec83-4cb0-a73d-d1a207876a19" />

- **Build a Copilot connector**
  
You can now get started with building a [Copilot connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-graph-connector) to bring your enterprise data to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Agents. This create new agent/app experience will help you get started by scaffolding all the code you need (creates connection via the Graph API, registers schema & maps items) to start ingesting items into the Microsoft Graph with a sample REST API datasource (GitHub issues API). Then, you can customize it to your needs and specific data sources to get more value from your enterprise data in Microsoft 365 Copilot! 

<img width="889" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7600b5a-0c38-4ee5-be35-15dcf7892289" />

- **Build Custom Engine Agent using Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**

We’ve introduced support for building Custom Engine Agents using the [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/agents-sdk-overview?tabs=csharp). This SDK is a flexible framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI-powered agents across multiple channels — such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, Teams, and custom apps — using the AI services of their choice. It simplifies the creation of agentic patterns with built-in support for state, storage, and channel-specific behaviors.

<img width="1089" alt="CEA-Agents-SDK" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df90331d-fd85-46bc-9d9a-4a1649d6e09c" />

- **Microsoft 365 Agents Playground**
We’re excited to introduce the [Microsoft 365 Agents Playground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-app-test-tool), a component evolved from Teams App Test Tool, which provides a web-based chat environment that simulates the behavior, look, and feel of various channels — such as Copilot and Microsoft Teams — allowing developers to test, debug, and iterate on their agent or app design without the need for complex setup.

<img width="711" alt="Agents-playground" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf9307d-84d0-42a3-bda6-d63e801acb14" />

- **[Preview Feature] Use TypeSpec to build Declarative Agent**

To enhance the developer experience for pro-code agent builders, we see strong value in introducing the option that leverages TypeSpec for Microsoft 365 Copilot. This approach provides a type-safe development experience, reduces dependency on JSON files, improves the developer's inner-loop and offer greater flexibility in generating artifacts for your agents and actions.

### Enhancement

- **Smooth installation for Microsoft 365 Agents Playground**: The toolkit will automatically install NodeJS to avoid unnecessary errors in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground installation, for users who don't have NodeJS installed on their machine.

- **Support SharePoint Framework v1.21**: For Teams tab app using SharePoint Framework, we upgrade to support v1.21.

### Bug Fix

- Enhanced compatibility with previous version of YAML files using old names to ensure smoother migration or continued use of existing projects.
  
- Upgraded dependencies like `axios` to address security vulnerabilities.

- Clear error messages for troubleshooting: Enhanced error messages by explicitly showing YAML file names where missing or unresolved environment variables or no valid app catelog. Show clear error messages to make it easier for users to identify and resolve configuration issues.

- Enhanced logging for CDP client and telemetry for agents development activites.

## 5.14.1 - Mar 28, 2025
This patch version update of Teams Toolkit includes several incremental enhancements and bug fixes:
- Updated manifest version for Declarative Agent to v1.3
- Added a warning message for upcomong CLI breaking changes in the next version

## 5.14.0 - Mar 24, 2025
This update represents a minor version increment of the Teams Toolkit, below is a comprehensive list of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes implemented since the last stable release.

### New Features

- **Switch Tenant**: Teams Toolkit now supports switching target tenant for users with multiple tenants in their Microsoft 365 or Azure account. A "Switch Tenant" button is located next to the account information, and the currently logged-in tenant is displayed alongside the account details.

<img width="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4c541ee-f79e-44cc-8f1e-84873a785c0e" />

- **Add Capability For Declarative Agent**: With Teams Toolkit, you can now enhance your Declarative Agent by integrating Web Search capabilities. This allows your agent to access and utilize information from the web, providing more accurate and relevant responses to your customers' queries.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ebc692-6985-424d-9819-3b263a7e7206)


- **Add Agent Debugging Experience**: To provide a better debugging experience for Agent developers, we have integrated the debugging experience in Microsoft 365 Copilot in-chat debugger (available in developer mode only). You can get a clear picture of what capability and action that your agent is set up with. You can easily view how your agent is executing actions and gain deeper insights into execution details, including success or failure hints for both capabilities and actions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db606aa-fbe9-4da5-a6bf-146d1d251abb)


- **Manage Authentication For Declarative Agent**: When adding actions to your Declarative Agent, you might encounter OpenAPI specifications that lack authentication configurations, even though the actual API calls require OAuth. To address this, we introduce commands that assist users to add and manage authentication for their agents. This enhancement would streamline the process and ensure that your API calls are properly authenticated, making it easier to work with your Declarative Agent.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23d7b4b7-962f-4948-a640-2afc0099c657)


- **Enable Adaptive Card Previewer For Declarative Agent**: We understand that designing an adaptive card for the Declarative Agent has been challenging due to compatibility issues with the Adaptive Card Previewer extension. We're excited to announce that we've now added support to preview Adaptive Card, making the process much smoother and more efficient for you. This enhancement ensures that you can seamlessly design adaptive cards without any hassle.

- **GitHub Copilot Extension Walkthrough**: To make it easier for users to get started with the GitHub Copilot Extension "@teamsapp," Teams Toolkit has added a walkthrough UI experience. This guide helps users understand how to install and use this helpful AI assistant to build Teams apps.

<img width="1306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af92cf1-c784-4e5c-ac2e-9a6e07133546" />

#### Enhancements


- **Use Existing Entra ID Instead of Always Create New**: Teams Toolkit creates Entra ID during debugging. While users are easily blocked by no permission to create Entra ID in their tenant. Now we improve this process to allow users to use an existing Entra ID which can be created by tenant admin. You will need to input the ID and password to continue.

- **Input OpenAI Key to Debug**: Custom Engine Agent projects require an OpenAI key for debugging. Teams Toolkit now allows users to create these projects without inputting the OpenAI key. However, missing this value will definitely cause a failure in preview and debugging. Therefore, an input box will pop up before debug to remind users of the required value.

<img width="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c197d84c-fa87-4269-bfb5-2609c6e00370" />

- **Declarative Agent API Key Authentication**: API Key Authentication in the DA project was implemented using Bearer Tokens in the past. Recently, the Teams platform has added support for developers to specify the key name in the API request header or query URL. As a result, we have updated the corresponding templates to reflect this change.
  
- **Microsoft Entra Manifest**: Teams Toolkit has updated Microsoft Entra app manifest to apply MS Graph format for better integration with platform.

- **Troubleshooting with GitHub Copilot Extension**: Teams Toolkit now improve the troubleshooting experience with GitHub Copilot extension by adding a "Resolve with @teamsapp" button, click this button will ask Teams Toolkit to open the output channel in the editor. Then the GitHub Copilot Chat will use the output log as a reference for troubleshooting requests. Consequently, @teamsapp can read the log and perform troubleshooting.

<img width="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60408b17-4cb2-4e80-805f-f554eae05661" />

- **Publish Teams App**: Refine the "Publish Teams App" UI in Teams Toolkit to reduce confusion. Now there are two buttons: one for publishing the Teams app to your organization and the other for publishing your app to the Teams store. The latter will require users to go to the Teams Developer Portal to complete the publishing process.

<img width="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7acfd7c-a29b-4bda-8baa-c3ff5f5c47c9" />

- **Upgrade to Node 22**: All the app templates in Teams Toolkit now are updated to support Node 22.

- **Add streaming experience in App Test Tool** 

- **Security Enhancement**: 1.Consolidate and standardize the Tab templates for quality and security. This involves ensuring consistency in the use of tools and dependencies, such as using npm packages instead of CDNs and updating the Teams JS version. 2. Upgrade python app templates to use MSI authentication when deploying to Azure.
