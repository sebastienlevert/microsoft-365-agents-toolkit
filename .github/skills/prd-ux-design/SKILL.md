# PRD + Scenario Design

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the task is to clarify or change product intent before engineering work begins:

- A PM or designer wants to add or update a PRD.
- A GitHub Issue, ADO Work Item, or chat request changes user-facing behavior.
- A VS Code, CLI, or cross-surface scenario needs design before specs.
- An engineering workflow finds missing, ambiguous, or unapproved PRD/scenario input.

Do not use this skill for specs, tests, code, or implementation. Handoff to engineering only after PRD + scenario artifacts are approved or explicitly confirmed as unchanged.

## Source locations

| Artifact | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| PRD pages and requirement deltas | `docs/01-product/prd/` | Markdown-only product intent: problem, users, scope, success criteria, constraints |
| Scenario directory guide | [`docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md) | Format rules for AI-readable scenario Markdown and human-readable scenario HTML |
| Scenario HTML components | [`docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-components/`](../../../docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-components/README.md) | Reusable VS Code-style static flow components and icon assets for scenario HTML |
| Scenario Markdown | `docs/01-product/scenarios/<group>/<scenario-slug>.md` | Concrete user flow: steps, states, edge cases, per-surface notes, inline Mermaid flow, and CLI E2E / VS Code UI test intent |
| Owner registry | [`docs/01-product/owner.md`](../../../docs/01-product/owner.md) | PM and Engineer owner lookup for PRD metadata |
| Mermaid flows | Inline Mermaid inside the owning scenario Markdown | AI-primary flow source embedded in the scenario contract |
| HTML artifacts | `docs/01-product/scenarios/<group>/<scenario-slug>.html` with the same basename as the owning Markdown when needed | Visual/state reference for humans, AI agents, and engineering; should concretize the Markdown flow and render the Mermaid reference from the owning Markdown; not the behavior source |
| Draft scenarios | `docs/01-product/scenarios/<group>/draft/<scenario-slug>.{md,html}` | In-flight redesign of an already-shipped scenario; PM-owned until the implementing change lands |
| Archived scenarios | `docs/01-product/scenarios/<group>/archive/<scenario-slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.{md,html}` | Snapshot of a previous live scenario taken at promotion time; historical reference only, not an active behavior contract |
| Product review stylesheet | [`docs/01-product/_assets/product-review/product-review.css`](../../../docs/01-product/_assets/product-review/product-review.css) | Shared page-level styles for product index and scenario HTML; not a behavior source |
| Product review index | [`docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html) | Human-facing locator for scenario HTML pages under `docs/01-product/scenarios/`; do not list README or Markdown source files |
| Product artifact renderer | [`docs/01-product/_assets/product-artifact-viewer/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/_assets/product-artifact-viewer/index.html) | Tooling-only renderer for Markdown artifacts; not a product artifact |
| Backups | `docs/01-product/_backups_/` | Pre-reorganization source material; not active PRD/scenario contract |

PRDs are high-level product documents. Scenarios split PRD intent into concrete flows such as creating, testing, or provisioning a DA. Scenario Markdown, including inline Mermaid, is the AI-primary source for experience behavior and later CLI E2E / VS Code UI test intent. HTML helps humans, AI agents, and engineering review layout, navigation, and visual states, but they must not derive specs, AC rows, tests, or behavior contracts from HTML alone.

Scenario HTML format, region structure, shared flow components, collapsible-section contract, and card-kind vocabulary are defined in [`docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md). Follow it as the source of truth — do not duplicate the rules here, and do not invent per-page CSS, scripts, or markup that re-implement behavior the shared scenario components already provide. If a new shared behavior is needed, extend `docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-components/` so every scenario benefits, rather than forking it inline in one page.

The active `docs/01-product/prd/` tree is intentionally Markdown-only. Do not put scenario flow blocks, HTML visual aids, or PRD-local navigation HTML under `prd/`; place scenario artifacts under `docs/01-product/scenarios/` and link them back to PRD requirement IDs.

The product root [`docs/01-product/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/README.md) is the AI-facing source/context for this workspace. The scenario directory guide [`docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md) is the only README under `docs/01-product/scenarios/` and defines the required group classification, Markdown format, and HTML format for scenario artifacts. The only active index-named HTML under this workspace is [`docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html), and it links only to human-readable scenario HTML pages.

Documents under `docs/01-product/_backups_/` are not active product contracts. Use them only as source material, and rewrite content into the current PRD or scenario schema before handoff.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Intake

Start from the concrete request: PM chat, GitHub Issue, ADO Work Item, or existing PRD/scenario page.

1. Clarify the user's need, trigger, affected persona, expected outcome, and requested review owner.
2. Inspect current PRDs and scenario groups to decide whether the request is already covered, needs a PRD update, needs a scenario update, or needs both.
3. Classify the change: `new PRD`, `PRD update`, `new scenario`, `scenario update`, or `no product design change needed`.
4. Identify PM owner, Engineer owner, affected persona, capability/domain, scenario group (`da`, `cea`, `others`, or approved new group), and user surface (`VS Code`, `CLI`, both, or neither). Use [`docs/01-product/owner.md`](../../../docs/01-product/owner.md) as the owner lookup, and cross-check package-level engineering owners with [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../../CODEOWNERS) when useful.
5. Read nearby product context: PRD pages, personas, capabilities, relevant scenarios, architecture constraints, and infrastructure constraints.

### Phase 2 — Ask before guessing

This mirrors **Global behavioral principle #1** in [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../../copilot-instructions.md): if the requirement, owner, success criteria, or user flow is unclear, stop and ask specific questions.

- GitHub Issue / ADO: comment with concrete questions and `@owner`.
- Chat: ask the user directly.
- Do not write specs, tests, or code while product or scenario ambiguity remains.

Good questions are answerable and scoped:

- "Is this flow required in VS Code, CLI, or both?"
- "What is the success state the user must see?"
- "Is this error recoverable in the same flow or does the user restart?"
- "Which persona owns the decision: developer, IT admin, or both?"
- "Who is the PM owner and who is the Engineer owner for this PRD?"

### Phase 3 — Draft PRD changes

Create or update Markdown under `docs/01-product/prd/`. Keep the PRD high-level, concise, and traceable:

```markdown
# <Capability or scenario name>

## Metadata

- Status: draft | review | approved | implemented | superseded | archived
- Created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
- Last updated: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
- PM owner: <owner-id or @handle from ../owner.md>
- Engineer owner: <owner-id or @handle from ../owner.md>
- Owner source: ../owner.md
- Related request: <GitHub issue, ADO work item, or chat summary>

## Problem
Who has the problem and why it matters.

## Goals
Measurable outcomes the change must enable.

## Non-goals
What this change intentionally does not solve.

## Users and scenario map
Personas, entry points, and links to concrete scenario flows under `../scenarios/<group>/`.

## Requirements
ID-based product requirements (`REQ-01`, `REQ-02`, ...).

## Success metrics
How PM/humans judge the change after release.

## Constraints and risks
Architecture, infrastructure, compliance, platform, or rollout limits.

## Open questions
Unresolved items that block scenario design, specs, or implementation.
```

Metadata rules:

- `Created` and `Last updated` use ISO 8601 UTC timestamps. If exact time is unavailable, use the current date with `T00:00:00Z`.
- Update `Last updated` whenever the PRD content or status changes.
- `PM owner` and `Engineer owner` must resolve to a human or team in `../owner.md`, or to a GitHub handle. Do not approve a PRD with `TBD` owners.
- `Status` tracks the PRD document lifecycle, not test or code state.
- `implemented` means the approved PRD has been delivered by the applicable engineering workflow; use `superseded` or `archived` when the product direction is no longer current.

### Phase 4 — Draft scenario changes

Create or update Markdown under `docs/01-product/scenarios/<group>/<scenario-slug>.md`. Keep scenario narrative, flow Mermaid, surface notes, state notes, and validation intent in that one Markdown file by default.

Required AI-primary content:

- Scenario narrative: user, trigger, goal, success state, scenario group, and stable scenario ID. This is the source of truth for CLI E2E and VS Code UI test intent.
- Surface behavior: VS Code, CLI interactive, CLI non-interactive, or not applicable. This refines surface-specific assertions inside the scenario file.
- Inline Mermaid flow: happy path, decision points, cancellation, errors, and recovery. This refines test paths without requiring a separate `.mmd` file.
- State notes: empty/loading/error/success/permission states when user-visible.
- User-visible outputs: a dedicated section (heading `## User-visible outputs` in Markdown, mirrored as a `<section>` such as `Files written after success` in the companion HTML) that enumerates every user-visible change the scenario produces, end-to-end. Required buckets:
  - **File changes** — every file created, modified, renamed, or deleted on disk. For each entry list the path, whether it is new or modified, the user inputs that drive its content, and which other steps reference it (for example, an action manifest picked in an earlier step). For modified files, identify the specific keys/lines/blocks the scenario writes, not just the file name.
  - **Notifications and prompts** — success notifications, info/warning toasts, modal confirmations, status-bar messages, and CodeLens labels the user must see, with their exact copy and any action buttons.
  - **Error and recovery messages** — every user-visible error string surfaced by this scenario, including recoverable inline errors, blocking dialogs, and CLI stderr lines, plus the user action that clears each one.
  - **Environment and secret writes** — env vars, `.env*` files, or secret store entries the scenario writes, including the variable names and which step produces them.
  - **External side effects** — provisioned cloud resources, registered apps, OAuth client registrations, telemetry events, or any other change visible outside the user's workspace.
  - Scaffolding-type scenarios (template scaffolding, `create-*` flows): list runtime-modified outputs (anything written based on user answers, injected by drivers, or conditional on user choice) in full. Boilerplate that is identical for every project from the template can be summarized in a single line such as "plus the standard template boilerplate under `appPackage/`, `infra/`, `env/`, `src/`" without enumerating individual files.
- Validation notes: how the scenario maps back to PRD requirement IDs, future spec AC rows, CLI E2E test intent, VS Code UI test intent, and deferred L2/L3 validation.

Optional visual/state reference content:

- Same-basename HTML mock/state artifact for VS Code wizard/webview layout or visually complex states, for example `scenarios/da/create-agent-from-template.md` and `scenarios/da/create-agent-from-template.html`.
- The HTML must link back to its owning Markdown source, concretize the flow with shared components, and render the Mermaid flow reference from the owning Markdown.
- The HTML should stay small enough for humans, AI agents, and engineers to inspect directly; use page-level review styles from `docs/01-product/_assets/product-review/product-review.css`, use shared VS Code-style controls and icons from `docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-components/`, and avoid embedding inline styles or a full Markdown renderer.

### Phase 4a — Scenario lifecycle (redesign of a live scenario)

When a shipped scenario needs to change because of a new feature, do not edit the live file in place. Use the three-bucket lifecycle so reviewers can compare in-flight design against shipped behavior, and so historical contracts stay traceable.

Each group directory holds three buckets:

- **Live**: `<group>/<slug>.{md,html}` — the shipped, behavior-of-record scenario. At most one per slug.
- **Draft**: `<group>/draft/<slug>.{md,html}` — the in-flight redesign. PMs author here; engineering writes specs and tests against it but does not ship the new flow yet. At most one in-flight draft per slug.
- **Archive**: `<group>/archive/<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.{md,html}` — a snapshot of the previous live version taken at promotion time. The date suffix is the UTC archive date; append `-2`, `-3` for same-day archives.

The stable `SCN-<ID>` is preserved across draft, live, and archive. The same flow keeps the same scenario ID across redesigns.

Lifecycle metadata fields used in addition to the standard scenario metadata:

| Field | Appears in | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Supersedes:` | Draft and new live | Path to the version this scenario replaces (draft → live; new live → archive snapshot). |
| `Replaced by:` | Archived | Path to the current live scenario that took over. |
| `Archived:` | Archived | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp when the file was moved into `archive/`. |
| `Redesign trigger:` | Draft | One-line reason: GitHub issue, ADO work item, or feature name. Removed when the draft is promoted. |

#### Open a draft

Trigger: a shipped scenario needs to change because of a new feature.

1. Copy (do not move) `<group>/<slug>.{md,html}` to `<group>/draft/<slug>.{md,html}`.
2. In the draft files set `Status: draft`, refresh `Last updated:`, add `Supersedes: ../<slug>.md`, and add `Redesign trigger: <issue or feature link>`.
3. Leave the live file unchanged. Its `Status` and behavior remain authoritative for shipped code.
4. Update [`docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html) to list the new draft under the Drafts section (Phase 4.5).

#### Iterate in the draft

- Treat the current live `<group>/<slug>.{md,html}` as the design baseline. Before editing the draft, re-read the live Markdown and HTML in full and reuse its scenario narrative, shared components, card layout, naming conventions, and state structure. The draft should read as a delta on top of live, not a parallel rewrite.
- Carry over anything that is not being explicitly redesigned: card titles, ordering, copy, asset choices, Mermaid node names, and engine-faithful snippets. Only diverge where the redesign actually requires it, and call out each divergence in the draft narrative or `Redesign trigger:` note so reviewers can diff against live.
- Cross-check sibling drafts in the same group for consistency (for example, a `create-*` draft and an `add-*` draft should share naming, env var, and file-shape conventions). When the redesign changes a convention, apply it to every affected draft in the same PR.
- All PRD and scenario design changes for the redesign happen inside `draft/<slug>.{md,html}`.
- Standard Phase 5 approval applies to the draft. Engineering can write specs and tests against the draft once the human owner approves it.
- The draft is not the behavior contract for shipped code. UI and E2E tests for shipped behavior still derive from the live file until promotion.

#### Promote draft to live (and archive the previous live)

Trigger: the draft is approved and the implementing change is ready to ship. Do all moves in one PR.

1. Archive the current live:
   - `git mv <group>/<slug>.md   <group>/archive/<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - `git mv <group>/<slug>.html <group>/archive/<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.html`
   - In the archived files set `Status: archived`, add `Archived: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`, add `Replaced by: ../<slug>.md`.
2. Promote the draft to live:
   - `git mv <group>/draft/<slug>.md   <group>/<slug>.md`
   - `git mv <group>/draft/<slug>.html <group>/<slug>.html`
   - In the new live files set `Status: approved` (or `implemented` if the implementing change lands in the same PR), refresh `Last updated:`, change `Supersedes:` to `archive/<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, and remove `Redesign trigger:`.
3. Update [`docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html): move the entry from Drafts to Live. Archive HTML is not added to the index.

#### Discard a draft

If the redesign is abandoned, `git rm` the entire `<group>/draft/<slug>.{md,html}` and remove its entry from the Drafts section of the index. The live file is untouched, and the archive bucket is not affected.

### Phase 4.5 — Update the human-facing product index

When adding, removing, renaming, moving between groups, or materially reorganizing human-readable scenario HTML under `docs/01-product/scenarios/` (including moves between live, draft, and archive buckets), update [`docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html).

The index is for human navigation and review. It should:

- Split entries into two sections:
  - **Live** scenarios: `<group>/<slug>.html`. Shipped, behavior-of-record flows.
  - **Drafts**: `<group>/draft/<slug>.html`. In-flight redesigns of live scenarios. Visible so reviewers can track upcoming changes; clearly labeled as not-yet-shipped.
- Do **not** list archive HTML (`<group>/archive/*.html`). Archives are reachable through repo navigation and the `Supersedes:` link from the current live scenario.
- Do not link README files, PRD Markdown, scenario Markdown, backups, or renderer/tooling HTML.
- Label artifact type (`HTML`) clearly.
- Preserve the source distinction: Markdown is the AI-primary behavior source; linked HTML is visual/state reference.
- Exclude renderer/tooling HTML from product artifact navigation.
- Avoid becoming the source of product behavior; behavior remains in Markdown.

### Phase 5 — Human approval gate

Before handoff, summarize the product design delta:

- PRD files changed or confirmed unchanged.
- Scenario files changed or confirmed unchanged, including group path.
- PRD metadata includes status, timestamps, PM owner, and Engineer owner.
- Product root index changed or confirmed unchanged.
- Product artifact renderer changed or confirmed unchanged when preview behavior changes.
- Open questions resolved or still blocking.
- Whether specs and implementation should proceed.

Ask for approval from the human owner. If approval is not available, stop with the open questions and do not hand off to implementation.

#### Rendered review links in the PR body

When opening (or updating) a PR that touches scenario HTML under `docs/01-product/scenarios/`, include side-by-side rendered diff links in the PR body so reviewers can read the design without cloning. Follow [`docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-diff-viewer/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-diff-viewer/README.md) for the URL template — do not duplicate it here.

- One link per scenario HTML changed in the PR (or per draft pair, when a draft is in flight).
- Pick the case from the viewer README: `Evolving draft` (base ref vs PR HEAD) when the file already existed on the base branch; `Brand-new draft` (live sibling vs draft) when the draft file is new in this PR.
- **Pin both sides to immutable refs.** Use the PR HEAD commit SHA for the new side, and either the base commit SHA or a tag for the baseline side. Never pin a review link to `dev`, `main`, or the PR branch name — those move and silently change the diff later.
- Both the viewer page itself and any side that lives only on the PR branch must be served from the PR HEAD SHA (the viewer is committed under `_assets/`).
- Note in the PR body that raw.githack shows an *External Content Notice* on first visit per browser, and the reviewer must click *Open the page* once.
- If a scenario HTML is brand-new and has no live sibling and no draft pair to diff against, link the standalone raw.githack preview pinned to the PR HEAD SHA instead of forcing a diff link.

### Phase 6 — Handoff to engineering

When approved, produce a short handoff packet:

```markdown
## PRD/scenario handoff

- Source request: <issue/chat/ADO link or summary>
- PRD artifacts: <links>
- Scenario artifacts: <links including scenario group>
- Scenario IDs: SCN-...
- Human review index: docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html
- PM owner: <owner-id or @handle>
- Engineer owner: <owner-id or @handle>
- PRD status: draft / review / approved / implemented / superseded / archived
- Requirement IDs: REQ-...
- Surfaces: VS Code / CLI / both
- Deferred validation: L2 CLI E2E scenarios, L3 VS Code UI scenarios
- Open questions: none / listed blockers
- Next step: engineering implementation workflow, or listed blocker if not ready
```

Only after this handoff should the engineering workflow generate or update specs, AC tables, tests, and code.

## Quality bar

- PRD states why, who, scope, non-goals, measurable success, constraints, and open questions.
- PRD metadata includes ISO 8601 `Created` and `Last updated` timestamps, PM owner, Engineer owner, owner source, related request, and status.
- PRD owners are resolvable through `docs/01-product/owner.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, or explicit human handles; `TBD` owners block approval.
- Scenario Markdown records behavior and state transitions, not just visuals.
- Markdown with inline Mermaid must be sufficient for an AI agent to understand behavior; HTML supplements visual structure and states when present.
- HTML, when present, is concise visual/state reference and cannot be the only source of behavior.
- The product root index links to newly added or renamed human-readable scenario HTML pages only.
- Every unresolved ambiguity is either answered by a human or listed as a blocker.
- No specs, tests, or implementation are changed by this skill unless the user explicitly pivots to the applicable engineering workflow.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Writing implementation details into PRD | Keep PRD at problem, scope, requirements, and success criteria; defer mechanics to specs. |
| Treating an HTML mock as the scenario contract | Move behavior into scenario Markdown with inline Mermaid; keep HTML as concise visual/state reference. |
| Re-implementing scenario HTML presentation per page (inline styles, ad-hoc `<details>` wrappers, hand-written badges, custom card markup) | Author scenario HTML per [`docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/README.md) using the shared scenario components and the documented region/card structure. Extend the shared components if something is missing. |
| Forgetting the product index | Add or update the artifact link in `docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`. |
| Leaving PRD owners as TBD | Resolve PM and Engineer owners through `owner.md`, CODEOWNERS, or a direct human answer before approval. |
| Forgetting metadata timestamps | Update `Last updated` and status whenever the PRD changes. |
| Treating `_backups_` as active source | Rewrite backup content into the current PRD or scenario schema before using it for handoff. |
| Skipping owner questions because the flow seems obvious | Ask the owner; ambiguous scenario design creates bad AC rows later. |
| Letting PRD/scenario work drift into code | Stop after approval and hand off to the applicable engineering workflow. |
| Creating AC rows in PRD | Use PRD requirement IDs; AC rows belong in operation specs. |
| Editing a live scenario in place when a new feature redesigns its flow | Open a draft under `<group>/draft/`, iterate there, then promote with archive in a single PR (Phase 4a). |
| Drafting a redesign without re-reading the current live scenario | Read live `<group>/<slug>.{md,html}` first and reuse its narrative, components, copy, and conventions; the draft should be a diff on top of live, not a parallel rewrite. |
| Letting sibling drafts in the same group drift from each other | Cross-check related drafts (for example `create-*` vs `add-*`) and apply convention changes consistently in the same PR. |
| Describing UI flow without listing user-visible outputs | Add a `## User-visible outputs` section that enumerates every file change, notification, error/recovery message, env/secret write, and external side effect the scenario produces. Without it, reviewers can't tell what the user actually ends up with. |
| Enumerating every template boilerplate file in a scaffolding scenario | List only runtime-modified outputs (driven by user answers, drivers, or conditional logic) in detail; collapse stock template boilerplate into a single "plus the standard template files" line. |
| Naming a file in an earlier step but not saying where later steps write into it | In the User-visible outputs section, link each file entry back to the step that picks/names it, and identify the specific keys/blocks that get written there. |
| Promoting a draft without archiving the previous live | Use `git mv` for both `.md` and `.html` so the previous live lands in `archive/<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.{md,html}` with `Status: archived` and `Replaced by:` set. |
| Moving only one of the `.md`/`.html` pair into draft or archive | Always move both, so the `<scenario-mermaid-flow src="<slug>.md">` reference stays resolvable next to its HTML. |
| Listing archive HTML in `docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html` | Only live and draft entries belong in the index; archives are repo-navigation only. |
| Opening a scenario-touching PR without rendered review links | Add side-by-side diff links to the PR body per [`docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-diff-viewer/README.md`](../../../docs/01-product/_assets/scenario-diff-viewer/README.md), one per changed scenario HTML or draft pair. |
| Pinning the rendered review link to a branch name (`dev`, `main`, the PR branch) | Pin both sides to immutable refs — the PR HEAD commit SHA for the new side, and a commit SHA or tag for the baseline — so the diff stays stable as branches advance. |

## Last todo of every PRD/scenario turn

For every scenario HTML added, renamed, moved between buckets (live/draft/archive) or groups, or removed in this turn, the matching entry in [`docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html`](../../../docs/01-product/scenarios/index.html) is updated in the correct section (Live or Drafts; archive HTML is never listed). If no scenario HTML changed, state that the index is intentionally unchanged.
